Package '**photobiologyFlecks**' it is at a very early stage of development. Thus, it is icomplete, subject to changes and not yet very useful.

The package attempts to facilitate the analysis of time series of irregulary varying irradiance data. It will support of fragmented time series were data acquisition takes place at high frequency during bursts separated by gaps with no data. As my own data consist in some cases in multivariate time series with several millions of observations grouped in bursts of tenths of thousands, I aim at efficient code. As a personal challenge, I aim to see if this is possible using pure R code with well know packages.

This package will be released as part of a suite of R packages for photobiological calculations described at the [r4photobiology](https://www.r4photobiology.info).

## Examples

No examples yet, as the data files that this package is designed to work with are too large to include as data in the package. A toy data set will be needed.

## Installation

Installation of the most recent stable version from CRAN:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# NOT IN CRAN
# install.packages("photobiology")
```

Installation of the current unstable version from R-Universe CRAN-like repository:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# NOT IN R-UNIVERSE
# install.packages('photobiology', 
#                  repos = c('https://aphalo.r-universe.dev', 
#                            'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

The two approaches above, automatically install dependencies.

Installation of the current unstable version from GitHub:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("aphalo/photobiologyFlecks")
```

Installation from GitHub sources does not automatically install dependencies. Once package 'photobiology' is installed, installation of the remaining or missing packages in the suite from CRAN (or by adding the repository information as above, also from R-Universe):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
intalled_pkgs <- installed.packages()[ , 1]
missing_pkgs <- setdiff(photobiology::r4p_pkgs, intalled_pkgs)
if (length(missing_pkgs) > 0) {
 install.packages(missing_pkgs)
}
```

## Documentation

HTML documentation is available at (<https://docs.r4photobiology.info/photobiologyFlecks/>), including an *User Guide*.

News on updates to the different packages of the 'r4photobiology' suite are regularly posted at (<https://www.r4photobiology.info/>).

Two articles introduce the basic ideas behind the design of the suite and describe its use: Aphalo P. J. (2015) (<https://doi.org/10.19232/uv4pb.2015.1.14>) and Aphalo P. J. (2016) (<https://doi.org/10.19232/uv4pb.2016.1.15>).

A book is under preparation, and the draft is currently available at (<https://leanpub.com/r4photobiology/>).

A handbook written before the suite was developed contains useful information on the quantification and manipulation of ultraviolet and visible radiation: Aphalo, P. J., Albert, A., Björn, L. O., McLeod, A. R., Robson, T. M., & Rosenqvist, E. (Eds.) (2012) Beyond the Visible: A handbook of best practice in plant UV photobiology (1st ed., p. xxx + 174). Helsinki: University of Helsinki, Department of Biosciences, Division of Plant Biology. ISBN 978-952-10-8363-1 (PDF), 978-952-10-8362-4 (paperback).
